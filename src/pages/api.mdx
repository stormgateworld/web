# Community API

Stormgate World provides a public API for the community to use. The API, just like the game, is currently in beta and may change without notice. The API is currently read-only and does not require authentication.

## Usage Guidelines

Feel free to use the API for your own projects, but please be considerate of the server load. Specifically, please do not crawl the API to make a full copy of data. If you need a full copy of the data please contact us and we can provide a dump.

If you made something cool with the API, please let us know! We'd love to feature it on our website.

> The API is currently in beta and may change, however we will try to maintain backwards compatibility as much as possible. Follow the Discord Channel for updates.

## Privacy

The API exposes player nicknames, Steam IDs, and match results following the [Privacy Policy](https://playstormgate.com/legal/privacy-policy) of Frost Giant Studios. Our backend includes features that will add control the visibility of player profiles (i.e. opt-out/private profiles) â€“ which may mean that some data is not available via the API. Please refer to our own [privacy policy](/privacy) for more information.

## OpenAPI Spec & Docs

The API is documented using the OpenAPI 3.1 specification. You can view the [auto-generated documentation](https://api.stormgateworld.com/swagger-ui/#/Leaderboards/getLeaderboard) and the specification in [openapi.json](https://api.stormgateworld.com/api-docs/openapi.json).

## FAQ

- **How did you get the data?**
  In collaboration with Frost Giant Studios we have created a system that fetches data from the game servers and stores it in normalized form. The API is a read-only interface to that data meant for community usage.
- **Where is the official API?**
  There is no official API yet. We're a fan made project trying to help the community by offering an API while the developers at Frost Giant Studios are busy building the game.
- **How often is the data updated?**
  The data is updated every 5 minutes.
